Python-FT2
==========
Python-FT2 is a ctypes binding for the FreeType2 project.


Dependencies
------------
ctypes, included in Python 2.5 +

Documentation
-------------
The freetype2 package is intended to be
exactly parallel to the freetype library interface.
A few systemic changes:
- The python package name is freetype2, all libfreetype
symbols are in that package but the leading FT_ has been
removed.  To closely parallel freetype code, consider
using this import statement:
    import freetype2 as FT
Now freetype library calls such as FT_Init_FreeType
become FT.Init_FreeType.
- All types must be instantiated in Python style 
by calling the class:
    bitm = FT.Bitmap()
- This is ctypes-based, so pointers are dereferenced
by accessing .contents, etc.
- See the test suite for examples of Python code.
