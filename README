Python-FT2
==========
Python-FT2 is a ctypes binding for the FreeType2 project.


Dependencies
------------
ctypes, included in Python 2.5 +
PIL, only if you want to run the test suite

Documentation
-------------
The freetype2 package is intended to be exactly parallel to the freetype 
library interface.

- The python package name is freetype2, the libfreetype symbols are 
  in that package but the leading FT_ has been removed.  
  To closely parallel freetype code, consider using this import statement:
    import freetype2 as FT
  Now freetype library calls such as FT_Init_FreeType become FT.Init_FreeType.
- All types must be instantiated in Python style by calling the class:
    bitm = FT.Bitmap()
- This is ctypes-based, so pointers are dereferenced by accessing .contents, etc.
  A general knowledge of ctypes is probably necessary to use this binding;
  you frequently need to construct pointers to structure objects, pass structures
  by reference, and so on to conform to the freetype API.
- Note that C++ freetype itself has both basic types that are pointers (FT_Face)
  and basic types that are structures (FT_Bitmap) in its interface.
  This is reproduced in the Python interface but obviously the mechanics
  of accessing them are different.
- See the test suite for examples of Python code.

Coverage
--------
I don't have an exact count of the coverage of freetype2.  The tutorials
are all ported but there are more routines still to be done.
