The test suites (but not python-ft2 itself) require PIL,
the Python Imaging Library, to write out the test images.
Once you have ensured you have PIL installed,
to run the test programs for python-ft2 simply type
  make test
The test programs will write out a series of image files
in PNG format to the temporary directory on your system
(usually /tmp on Linux or Mac OS X; 
C:\Documents and Settings\%USER%\Local Settings\Temp 
on Windows).

The expected appearance of the images can be seen in 
the samples in the "output" subdirectory of this directory.
Small differences in appearance may ensure from different
versions of freetypes.  These images were created with
freetype 2.3.12 on Mac OS X 10.6.

Unfortunately no automatic image differencer has yet been
integrated into the build procedure; you need to manually
check the images or use a program like perceptualdiff
http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/.

The test programs for python-ft2 are ports of the Freetype2
tutorials from the web pages:
http://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step1.html
http://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step2.html
The tutorials are explanatory rather than runnable programs,
so although the test programs follow the tutorials as closely as 
possible some changes were necessary.
